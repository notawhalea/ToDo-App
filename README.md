**ToDo App by React.JS**:clipboard:

Main stack of this application: *JavaScript, React.JS*:stuck_out_tongue:

This is my *vision* for the implementation of the *task of creating a ToDo App*.
**********
**What I've done**:question:

Look at the app screenshot below. Let's look at the main components of the application:
1. In the input line we enter the text of our new note.
2. By clicking the *Submit* button(button №2), the note will be added to the note sheet.
3. By clicking the *Reset* button(button №3), all notes will be deleted.
4. By clicking the *Clear Completed Todos* button(button №4), all completed notes will be deleted.
5. By clicking the *Delete* button(button №5), the selected note will be deleted.
6. By clicking the *Done* button(button №6), the selected note will be marked as completed (if you press it again, the action will be canceled).
**********
**User guide**:paperclip:
1. Download zip-archive with code and open it in *VSCode/WebStorm*.
2. Change directory in console to first/second version
   `cd ToDo-App`
3. In console write next command to install all dependencies and modules for our project.
   `npm install`
4. Then in console write next command to start program in live server.
   `npm start`
5. In browser search bar type next text `http://localhost:3000/` or it will open automatically
6. Enjoy it!
